<h1>Who Am I </h1>
<body>
  Hello world I'm Dennis and i would describe myself as a hard working person who tries his best all the time. I'm 16 years old and will turn 17 on November 17. I am currently a senior at Bronx Early College Academy and plan on going to college. I have not decided on where i want to go to college but my preferred choice would be somewhere in New York or Conneticut so that im closer to family.
