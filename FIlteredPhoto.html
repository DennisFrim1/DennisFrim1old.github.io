I started this project by searching for a picture that I liked and downloaded it into Adobe Photoshop. After this I did things like duplicating the image and flipping it to one side, reversing the image so that it mirrors the original image and then flipped them horizontally. Through a lot of filter changing and deciding on what color I wanted to have on the image, I was able to follow the rest of the steps on the assignment and complete it. After making all the adjustments on the assignment, my original photo’s color and direction changed as the angle of the new photo was changed to 45º. The new photo looks completely different from the original one.

	<body>To make my pixel character, I used the tools by using the pencil tool to form my character’s face. I mostly used this tool but when I messed up, I pressed command + z and the eraser tool. I then started by deciding what color I wanted to use for my character’s skin tone.  My character looks like the Chicago rapper, Lucki but I wanted to make a superhero like character, but as I kept adding things, it started to look like Lucki. My character is wearing a purple sweatshirt, 2 pieces of jewelry, black jeans, and red octobers. He also has a light blue cap on. My character would be in a game that requires shooting at zombies to get into your home. Their purpose in the game would be to defeat the zombies and get home safely without losing a life.

	<body>I made this project by choosing what object I wanted to start with and ended up choosing a panther figure. After that I wanted to change the color and chose pink. After that I added a drop shadow to the picture to make the figure pop out more.
The shape I used as the base was the panther shape and colored it pink and a light green-ish lime color. 
I noticed that as I kept duplicating and merging my shape, it formed a spherical shape and created a spiraling image.

	<body>I changed the colors by trying to match the color that is picked with the person’s skin tone. The tools I used to complete this task were swatches that I put into a new folder that contained all the colors I wanted to use to color my portrait. I also changed the hue of the images to create different images. I chose Steve Harvey for my project because I found a picture of him that I thought was good for this project. Steve Harvey is a television host, producer, actor and comedian and is most well known for hosting the show, Family Feud.

	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<body>
My social justice topic is affordable healthcare and I chose this topic because it’s something that needs to be addressed as it’s not easy for everyone to afford healthcare. This topic is important because everyone deserves to have affordable healthcare and shouldn't be paying so much to save their lives. I want the viewers to know about the numerous protests about affordable healthcare and how the government needs to reduce the prices of medical bills. I honestly didn’t really have a preference of where I wanted to put certain images but on some pictures, I wanted to make sure the messages on the posters were shown correctly.
